# catptioner
- to automate the making of closed-caption-cat images
- see this: https://github.com/fussyfangz/closed-caption-cats

stuff to do:
-  ~~split lines when they get too long~~ (done but slightly better this time)
-  ~~do not split line in the middle of a word~~ (will now only split lines at spaces, not sure how this will go but it seems to be fine so far)
-  make text a little bit smaller than the text background (i keep forgetting -\_-)
-  be able to make captions over 2 lines long !!!
-  add confirmation before saving
